More Bows: Restrung is a port / continuation of the More Bows mod, which was originally created by GaussFire, and maintained & updated by iDiamondhunter until Risugami's ModLoader was no longer updated. This port aims to faithfully re-create the original mod, while fixing bugs, introducing quality-of-life changes, and re-adding cut ideas.

For more information on the content included in the mod, see the README file of the branch of the mod that you wish to use.
