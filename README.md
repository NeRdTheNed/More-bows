This is a port of the More Bows mod to 1.7.10! This mod was originally created by GaussFire, and then maintained & updated by iDiamondhunter. This port aims to faithfully re-create the original mod, while fixing some bugs & potentially introducing new mechanics (or re-adding cut ideas!).

### Original descriptions of each bow (not currently 100% accurate!):

- Reinforced Bow ![Reinforced Bow Icon](src/main/resources/assets/morebows/textures/item/stone_bow.png): This bow is just like the regular wooden bow, but has more durability.
- Iron Bow ![Iron Bow Icon](src/main/resources/assets/morebows/textures/item/iron_bow.png): This bow is a step up from the reinforced bow, having slightly more damage and durability, along with a minuscule upgrade of draw speed.
- Golden Bow ![Golden Bow Icon](src/main/resources/assets/morebows/textures/item/gold_bow.png): The bow forged of gold: it has a pathetic amount of uses but overall does the most damage. Quick reflexes allow you to shoot at double the speed!
- Crystal Bow ![Crystal Bow Icon](src/main/resources/assets/morebows/textures/item/diamond_bow.png): A bow sealed with the power of diamond, not many can survive it's swift and damaging moves. With a diamond base, you don't need to worry about over-pulling, this bow also doubles your draw speed!
- Blazing Bow ![Blazing Bow Icon](src/main/resources/assets/morebows/textures/item/flame_bow.png): A bow from the horrible pits of the Nether, the power of fire emanates from the weapon in your hand. With this bow, you can do double the damage of a normal bow, while setting your foes alight!
- Ender Bow ![Ender Bow Icon](src/main/resources/assets/morebows/textures/item/ender_bow.png): A mysterious bow with the secrets of the Ender within. Along with having a slow drawback, it will use the Ender's technique to shoot a regular arrow that will not damage anything but, after 3 seconds, will summon 5 more arrows to kill it's opponents.
- Legia Bow ![Legia Bow Icon](src/main/resources/assets/morebows/textures/item/multi_bow.png): The final and most overwhelming bow, it delivers fast and many blows to its enemies. Even with two arrows, your draw speed will be faster than the iron bow!
- Frost Bow ![Frost Bow Icon](src/main/resources/assets/morebows/textures/item/frost_bow.png): Bonus bow for Christmas! Present for everyone who was supporting iDiamondhunter with the mod! This bow makes entities go slowly but its draw speed is awful. It also creates a snow layer on impact, and freezes water!
